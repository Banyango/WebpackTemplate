#Webpack Template

Github now lets you create a repo based on a template so I made a little webpack template for my own purposes. Has webpack and typescript set up. Should be able to get up to speed quickly.


### Getting started

See [github templates](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) for more info on forking.

Once you've cloned your repo.

To install run

`npm i`
